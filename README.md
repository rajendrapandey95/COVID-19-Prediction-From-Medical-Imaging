## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated the development of rapid and accurate diagnostic tools. Medical imaging, such as chest X-rays and CT scans, provides a non-invasive method to detect lung abnormalities associated with COVID-19. This project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models to enhance the detection of COVID-19 from medical images.

## Objectives

### Aim
- **Objective**: To accurately predict COVID-19 infection status utilizing medical imaging data.
- **Enhancement of Diagnostic Precision**: To augment the accuracy of diagnosis and facilitate early detection through sophisticated image-based prediction models.
- **Support for Existing Testing Methods**: To provide a supplementary diagnostic tool that is particularly beneficial in resource-limited environments.

## Applications

- **Healthcare Triage Improvement**: To streamline triage processes in clinical settings, enabling rapid identification of COVID-19 cases and optimizing patient management.
- **Population Screening**: To support large-scale screening initiatives, aiding in the detection of asymptomatic individuals who may be carriers of the virus.
- **Public Health Strategy and Resource Allocation**: To generate predictive insights from medical imaging data, informing public health policies and optimizing the allocation of healthcare resources.

## Architectural Framework

Our implementation uses advanced neural network architectures, including:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Utilized for processing and feature extraction from medical images.
- **Transfer Learning Models**: Pre-trained models such as VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 fine-tuned for COVID-19 detection.
